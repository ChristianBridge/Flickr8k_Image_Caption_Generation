### Project Overview
This project was for my Data Science II class during my Master's in Data Science. My team set out to create a model which would generate captions for images using the Flickr8k dataset. We used TensorFlow and Keras to
create a Convolutional Neural Network and Long-Short Term Memory structure. Overall the model ended up stalling around 40% accuracy while the training continued to overfit. There are many improvements that could be made on this model
including a better embedding model for the captions, better validation tools for the output captions, more data pre-processing, and spending time tweaking hyper parameters such as training epochs, training time, learning rate, and 
CNN layers. Overall our goal was to begin working with computer vision and develop a better understanding of use-cases, TensorFlow, Keras, and the overall pipeline.
